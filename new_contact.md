## `new_contact()` function

The function begins with an _indefinite while loop_, where it asks the user to enter the **name**, **address**, **phone number**, and **email address**.

``` 
Please enter the following details:
> Name: <user_name>
> Address: <user_address>
> Phone number: <user_phone-number>
> Email address: <user_emailID>
```

After hitting enter, the contact is saved and the confirmation prompt prints.

```
Contact details saved successfully âœ“
```

After saving the contact it asks the user whether they wish to add another contact.

``` 
Do you want to add another contact (y/n) ?:
```
