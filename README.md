<h1 align = "center"> ðŸ“ž Contact-Book ðŸ“• </h1>

 A virtual contact book in **Python** where users can add new contacts, and also view, edit, and delete them.

Following are the main components of the program responsible for the whole functioning:
- ***Global Variable `contacts`***
   * `contacts` is the **global _dictionary_ variable**, used by every functionality given below.

- `new_contact()`
   * Function for **adding** a new contact to the contacts-list.
   
- `del_contact()`
   * Function for **deleting** a specific contact / deleting all the contacts at once.
   
- `edit_contact()`
   * Function for **updating** the details of a specific contact in the contact list.
   
- `view_contact()`
   * Function for **viewing** the details of a specific contact in the contact list.
   
 The above mentioned components constitute the main function `contactBook()`

 ### **`contactBook()` function**
 
 ```
 ------------ Contact Book ------------
Enter:-
[0] to add a New Contact
[1] to view your Contacts
[2] to edit a Previously Existing Contact
[3] to delete a Previously Existing Contact

Enter your choice:
```

 The function begins with an _indefinite while loop_, where, it asks the user for their choice of action using simple selection statements.
 After the completetion of each iteration, it asks the user whether to open the contact book again.
 
 ```
 Do you want to open your Contact Book again (y/n) ?:
 ```
 
 > The contacts are saved only during the program execution. After termination, the contacts are not saved externally.

## Future Aspirations for the project

- [x] Contact-Book made functional for terminal-use.
- [ ] Contact-Book made more functional by saving contacts externally.
- [ ] Conact-Book equipped with **GUI**.

I had made this project for improving my programming skills (especially in Python). Completing this much of the project was just the 1st step towards the final completion. What I aspire to be the 2nd, and certainly the last step for this project is the implementation of SQL database using the `sqlite3` module.

This would not only allow the user to use the program for real life use, but also strengthen our command in the field of **Database Management** in Python.
I hope it'd get done soon ^_^
